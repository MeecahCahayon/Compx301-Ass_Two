Since the wildcard specification wasn't precise, we thought that it would be okay to have a legal expression if there's no literal to match. 

For example, if the expression is "ABC." and the string is "ABC" then this would still work. 

Any other regexp specification is exactly as instructed, hence any doubled symbols (i.e ??, **, etc) will be seen as an illegal expression, unless preceeded by a \.
